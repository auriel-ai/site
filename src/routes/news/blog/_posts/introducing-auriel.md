# Introducing Auriel: Building in the Age of AI

We're thrilled to announce the launch of **Auriel** - a suite of open-source developer tools designed to bring clarity and control to LLM applications and AI agents. In a world where AI is becoming increasingly complex and unpredictable, we're building the tools developers need to build, monitor, and optimize their AI applications with confidence.

## The Challenge: Building Reliable AI Applications

As AI applications become more sophisticated, developers face unprecedented challenges:

- **Unpredictable Behavior**: LLMs can produce inconsistent outputs and hallucinations, making it difficult to ensure reliable performance
- **Cost Management**: AI operations can quickly become expensive, with costs that are hard to predict and optimize
- **Debugging Complexity**: Traditional debugging tools fall short when dealing with AI's non-deterministic nature
- **Performance Optimization**: Understanding and improving AI application performance requires specialized tools and insights

## Our Solution: A Suite Of Free & OSS Developer Tools

### AgentLens: A Lightweight AI Development Companion

Our flagship tool, [AgentLens](https://github.com/auriel-ai/agentlens), provides developers with:

- **Offline Debugging**: Test and debug AI interactions in a controlled environment
- **Cost Analytics**: Track, analyze, and optimize your AI operation costs
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and address failure patterns before they impact users
- **Performance Insights**: Deep dive into conversation metrics and optimization opportunities

> Stay tuned for more tools in our pipeline! We're working on additional solutions to help developers build, test, and deploy AI applications with confidence.

## Beyond Tools: Complete AI Solutions

While our core focus is on developer tools, we also build specialized AI agents for specific use cases or needs. For example, [Propscan](https://propscan.uk/) helps property investors make data-driven decisions using authentic AI-powered insights and [SAM](https://samfire.uk) helps firefighters in any British Fire & Rescue Service with their initial operational training phase before qualifing as component.

## Our Commitment to Open Source

We believe in the power of community-driven development. That's why our core tools are MIT-licensed, allowing developers to:

- Use our tools freely in their projects
- Contribute to their development
- Build upon our work to create new solutions
